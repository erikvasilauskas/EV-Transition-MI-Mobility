# Reports

Use this folder to store communication-ready outputs, including dashboards, static charts, and narrative summaries.

- Save high-resolution figures to `figures/`.
- Save aggregated tables or CSV exports to `tables/`.
- For longer-form writeups, add a Markdown or PDF file with versioned filenames.

Keep a changelog when reports are refreshed to help stakeholders track updates.
