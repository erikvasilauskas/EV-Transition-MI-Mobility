# Documentation

Brief references, assumptions, and methodological notes live here. Group related notes together to make it easy for collaborators to follow the project narrative.

Suggested sub-files:

- `segment_definitions.md`: Working definitions for the ten supply-chain segments.
- `methodology.md`: Decisions about data prep, allocation rules, and weighting strategies.
- `data_sources.md`: Source catalog with access links, refresh cadence, and licensing information.

Add additional markdown files in this folder as the project evolves.
