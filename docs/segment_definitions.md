# Supply-Chain Segment Definitions

Document the ten Michigan automotive supply-chain segments used in this analysis. Update the working segment names, include example industries, and note any data caveats.

| Segment ID | Working Name | Description | Example NAICS Codes | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 6 |  |  |  |  |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |
| 8 |  |  |  |  |
| 9 |  |  |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |  |  |

Add supplementary notes as the segment definitions mature, such as crosswalks to other taxonomies or segment-specific data quality concerns.
