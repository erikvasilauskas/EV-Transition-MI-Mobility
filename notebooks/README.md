# Notebooks

Store exploratory analyses and presentation-ready notebooks here. Prefix filenames with an ordinal to reflect execution order, e.g., `01_data_audit.ipynb`.

Recommended sections inside each notebook:

- Project context and research questions.
- Data loading and cleaning steps.
- Exploratory analysis and visualization.
- Key findings and follow-up tasks.

Export figures or tables needed for external sharing to `reports/`.
