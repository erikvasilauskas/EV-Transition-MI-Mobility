# Source Code

Organize reusable analysis code here. Package code into modules so notebooks stay concise.

Suggested layout:

- `data_processing/`: Extract, transform, and load routines for raw inputs.
- `analysis/`: Business logic that aggregates staffing data by segment.
- `visualization/`: Charting helpers and report generation scripts.

Add `__init__.py` files if you convert this into a Python package later.
